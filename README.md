# Project: Simple Chat with Python - Hyperskill
<hr />

## Project Overview
This project is designed to introduce beginners to basic Python programming concepts and create a simple chatbot as part of the Hyperskill Python track.

## Features
- **Greeting Functionality**: Introduces the bot and its creation year
- **Name Reminder**: Allows the user to remind the bot of their name
- **Age Guessing Game**: Uses remainders to estimate the user's age
- **Counting Function**: Proves the bot's ability to count to any number
- **Programming Knowledge Test**: Assesses the user's understanding of methods in Python
 
## Technologies Used
* **Python** For creating  the chatbot program

## Installation
To run this program locally:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the provided Python script (e.g., `bot.py`) to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the script using the command: `python bot.py`

## Usage
1. Run the script
2. Follow the prompts to interact with the chatbot
3. Answer questions when asked during the programming knowledge test

## Code Structure
The script is organized into several functions, each handling a specific interaction with the user:
These functions are defined sequentially in the script, allowing for a smooth flow of interactions with the user. The main program calls these functions in order to execute the chatbot's various capabilities.
